# Decisions Locked — Do Not Re-Open

## Rejected options — do not re-propose
These were explicitly discussed and closed. Do not re-propose. Do not ask clarifying questions about them. If the user raises one, acknowledge the prior decision and ask if they want to formally reopen it.

- **Silent revert on invalid input** — causes silent data loss. Use inline error, field stays editable.
- **Lock user to workout page until finished** — replaced with free navigation + ActiveWorkoutContext + "Resume Workout" FAB.
- **Standalone workout templates** — redundant with programs model; conflicts with future sharing. Every workout belongs to a program.
- **"Start Workout" FAB on all tabs** — confusing. FAB shows "Start Workout" on Logs tab only; "Resume Workout" globally when active.
- **Explicit Save button on Profile** — auto-save on blur. Exception: WorkoutDetailPage edit mode keeps "Save Edits".
- **window.confirm / window.prompt** — replaced with Modal component throughout (R2).
- **workoutSets table + isWarmup field for MVP** — deferred; lands with recommendation engine in v2.
- **Heaviest set for target derivation** — first set chosen instead; template target = starting weight, not peak.
- **Per-set targets on WorkoutTemplatePage** — deferred to v2 alongside workoutSets.
- **Store raw number without canonical unit** — breaks silently when user switches unit preference. All weights stored in lb, heights in inches — convert at display time only.
- **No unit label on weight inputs** — users can't tell what unit they're entering in. Unit label always shown beside every weight input (lb or kg from UserSettingsContext).
- **No unit selection at signup** — defaults to imperial silently; metric users corrupt all historical data before discovering the Profile toggle. Unit preference is selected at signup.
- **Store unit per entry (Option C)** — adds schema complexity for imperceptible gain (~0.1% drift); revisit if high-precision features (1RM calculator) are added.
- **Tailwind CSS** — CSS Modules retained for MVP; revisit before next major feature phase.
- **Zustand / Jotai** — per-page useState retained for MVP; evaluate post-MVP.
- **sessionStorage for auth** — switched to localStorage; user stays logged in across tab closes.
- **Blue accent (#4F8EF7)** — generic, used by every fitness app, does not support nature theme.
- **Electric green (#39FF14)** — neon/tennis ball, synthetic, fails all-ages readability.
- **Warm orange (#F97316)** — reads as warning/alert, conflicts with red's semantic role.
- **Pure dark forest green (#1A4731, #1B4332)** — too dark for interactive elements on dark background.
- **Filled circle nav indicator** — replaced with 2px accent line above active tab.
- **12px nav tab labels** — too small for all-ages; locked at 14px.
- **Workout summary screen at finish (OD4)** — post-MVP, not in build scope.
- **Elapsed workout timer (OD5)** — post-MVP, not in build scope.

## What is fully locked
- DB schema v2 (8 tables) — see master-schematics.md
- All service contracts — see master-schematics.md Service Layer
- All user flows — Logs (complete), Programs (complete)
- All design decisions #1–23 — see master-schematics.md Key Design Decisions
- All planning items P1–P9 resolved
- Tech stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + React Router v7 + CSS Modules + Dexie.js v4
- Auth: localStorage, plain text password (MVP only)
- State: per-page useState/useEffect + 3 shared contexts (Auth, UserSettings, ActiveWorkout)
- ActiveWorkoutContext initializes on app mount — not just on login
